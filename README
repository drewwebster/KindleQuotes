Current version of KindleQuotes is currently in the works...

This new version is actively being developed and, therefore, the code here will be in various stages of functionality.


KindleQuotes takes your clippings file, called "My Clippings.txt", from your Kindle, parses this data into an SQlite database file, 
and then provides a way to view, search and share all of your highlighted passages and notes.

The initial version (commented on below) would parse a provided clippings file and generate HTML that could be stylized and included
in a wrapper page, or dumped in MySQL. The new version aims to provide better cross-platform support and portability. Currently, this 
involves utilizing file-based database system, SQlite, and a Tkinter GUI. The only modules needed that aren't naturally available in 
the average Python install is PySQlite2, but will most likely be bundled in when with KindleQuotes when completed.

More details will be provided soon.
