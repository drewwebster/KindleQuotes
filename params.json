{"name":"Kindlequotes","body":"Current version of KindleQuotes is currently in the works...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mutaku/KindleQuotes/wiki\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new version is actively being developed and, therefore, the code here will be in various stages of functionality.\r\n\r\n** Now supports sharing on Facebook!\r\n\r\nKindleQuotes takes your clippings file, called \"My Clippings.txt\", from your Kindle, parses this data into an SQlite database file, \r\nand then provides a way to view, search and share all of your highlighted passages and notes.\r\n\r\nThe initial version (commented on below) would parse a provided clippings file and generate HTML that could be stylized and included\r\nin a wrapper page, or dumped in MySQL. The new version aims to provide better cross-platform support and portability. Currently, this \r\ninvolves utilizing file-based database system, SQlite, and a Tkinter GUI. The only modules needed that aren't naturally available in \r\nthe average Python install is PySQlite2, but will most likely be bundled in when with KindleQuotes when completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo access your clippings file, mount your Kindle device and navigate to Documents within the root. It will be found in that directory\r\nalong with your books. It will be called \"My Clippings.txt\" and you may load this directly into KindleQuotes, or better, copy to your\r\nmachine first.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore details will be provided soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired Software (should later come packaged):\r\n- pysqlite2 and sqlite3\r\n- python (w/tk)\r\n- tktreectrl*\r\n- fbconsole\r\n\r\n*tktreectrl can be tricky to setup depending on the platform. \r\nInstructions to come, but you can get started by following the \r\ninstructions on the tktreectrl site \r\n(http://klappnase.bubble.org/TkinterTreectrl/). You'll need to grab the \r\nzip \r\nfile provided for the python module and the archive through sourceforge \r\nfor the tcl/tk bindings.\r\n\r\nFor now, a few beta(!) screens.\r\n\r\n![main](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c1.png)\r\n***\r\n![user's books](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c2.png)\r\n***\r\n![quotes for book](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c3.png)\r\n***\r\n![view quote](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c4.png)\r\n***\r\n![post to facebook with comment](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c5.png)\r\n***\r\n![posted on facebook](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c7.png)\r\n***\r\n![search](http://pathofthesamurai.com/kq_c6.png)","tagline":"Store, View, Search, and Share Kindle Bookmarks, Quotes, and Highlights with Python and Tkinter","google":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">    var _gaq = _gaq || [];   _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-30545181-1']);   _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);    (function() {     var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;     ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
